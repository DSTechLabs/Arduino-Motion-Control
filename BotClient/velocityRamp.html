  <h1>Velocity Ramp</h1>
  <hr>

  Velocity Ramping is where the speed of a motor is gradually increased to a desired speed,<br>
  runs at that speed and then is gradually decreased to a stop. &nbsp;Robotic and automation<br>
  motors need to do this to eliminate the mechanical “shock” of a sudden start or stop of equipment.<br>
  If a car stopped instantly at a traffic light, we’d be thrown through the windshield!<br>
  <br>

  The Arduino Firmware runs the stepper motors using velocity ramping. &nbsp;There are 10<br>
  different “slopes” that are settable for the velocity ramp: 0 = no ramping (instant start/stop) ...<br>
  9 = very gradual start/stop. &nbsp;When the Firmware starts up, the default slope is 6.<br>
  <br>

  Use low values (1, 2, ..) for fast accelerations with light loads and high values (.., 8, 9)<br>
  for slow accelerations with heavy loads. &nbsp;It is highly recommended to use slow accelerations<br>
  when moving high inertial loads.<br>
  <br>

  If we were to plot the velocity of a motor shaft (in steps per second) it would look like a trapezoid:<br>
